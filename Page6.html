    <p>Ed and Lola had known each other since they were children. She was the girl next door and he was the star quarterback of the local football team. When they were younger, they were inseparable. As the years went by, they grew apart. Lola had become a bit of a recluse while Ed, on the other hand, was a social butterfly. He enjoyed making people laugh, believing wholeheartedly that positive energy is easily transferred through a smile. Lola experienced a traumatic childhood and witnessed first-hand the evils that inhabit the Earth. The sparkle in her eye disappeared along with her innocent smile. </p>
  </li>
  <li class="w3-theme-d1">
    <p>She spent a lot of time wandering off alone to tend to her intrusive thoughts. Little did she know Ed would watch from his bedroom window wishing he had the guts to tell her she was still worth saving. The love he felt for her as a boy grew and intensified with every year that passed. </p>
  </li>
  <li class="w3-theme-d4">
    <p>One late evening Ed could not sleep and decided to step outside for some fresh air. While he was sitting on the front step, he saw Lola leave her house and walk off by herself. He worried for her safety considering how late it was. He argued with himself for a few moments before concluding to follow her. This was his chance to come clean and pour his heart out.</p>
