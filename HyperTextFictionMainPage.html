<p>On a late night, Lola decided to go on a walk accompanied only by her thoughts. </p>

<p> A walk she has taken numerous times before when the overwhelming need to decompress arose. Like any other night, the sounds of nature penetrated the air as a fresh breeze blew through the tree limbs causing the leave to rustle.</p>

<p>Lola began walking along the route she had always taken when she came across an unknown fork in the path. She found this to be strange as she stopped and thought to herself:</p><p> “How could I have missed this before? Should I go<p/> <p><a href="page1.html">down the path I know</a> or <a href="page2.html">venture off into the unknown</a>?”</p>
