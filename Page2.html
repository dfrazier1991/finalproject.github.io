		<p>Feeling adventurous, Lola ignored the pit in her stomach and started towards the foreign path. As she was moving through the thick brush and branches, she noticed the outline of a person limping just a few feet ahead. She called out to the figure “Hey! Are you alright?” She waited a few seconds for the person to reply but got no response.</p>

	<div class="column" style="background-color: none;">
		<p>She assumed the person did not hear her, so she lightly jogged ahead to catch up to them. She was a few paces behind the mysterious person when they turned around to faced her.

Within seconds the man <a href="page5.html"><i>disappeared</i></a> before her very eyes.</p>
